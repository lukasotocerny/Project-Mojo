<h2>Project Mojo - Mobile phone dating app using Ionic framework</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The key idea behind Mojo is connecting people not primarily based on their physical appereance. It is done in a clever way of asking questions.
Users write their own 3 questions that they want others to answer. Now in order to connect to another person, one firstly sees only
his first question. If he/she answers correctly, they pass onto second question, then third and then they see the profile picture.</p>
<p>Some may argue that this is a feature to be added to already existing sites, having a disadvantage of narrowing the connection chances
for a user even more. But the key concept of Mojo is asymmetry. One has to answer three questions correctly in order to request, the
second party only confirms/declines.</p>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
The main app's functionality is in `/js/controller.js`, where there are scripts defining the behaviour in each of the UI-Router states.
Mojo is written using the AngularJS framework, therefore HTML files in `/templates/` are binded through scopes. Ionic uses open-source
UI-Router library, which helps navigation in the app through states. The server database operation can be found in the folder `/server`, 
where are the `.php` scripts with SQL queries.

<h3>End Product</h3>
<p>After a summer spend on programming the app, it is a functional app. It has basic user interface, sufficient enough for it to 
serve as a neat minimal viable product. Surely it is only an alpha version, I could not have it passed through the Google Store as
it requires lots of polishing, policies, debugging and many other stuff. I have worked on this app on my own.</p>

<h3>Marketing point-of-view</h3>
<p>Importantly to mention, technology on its own is not sufficient enough. Even though I have learned a lot during the actual process of app 
development, what I have found out later on was even more useful. Mojo is not a good business idea. There are several reasons for that. The
app industry is an oversaturated market. There are thousands of apps with little niches, even though average user uses not even a dozen. Just
take dating industry on its own. There are more than 1000 new dating services entering the industry every year, making it hard to break through
as anywhere else.</p> 
<p>Another reason is that Mojo does not solve any real problem that customer might have. It attempts to find a user relationship, but similar is done
by other thousands of dating apps. And lastly, but not least, the revenue model is weak. It would be a bet into the future, that has no way of covering
its short run costs apart from being relying on unexpected investment. That is not a good model.</p>
